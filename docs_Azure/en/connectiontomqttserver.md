#### Connecting to MQTT server
---
[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/)
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a message protocol based on the TCP/IP
protocol stack and supports asynchronous communication between the parties. MQTT separates
the sender from the receiver in space and time, so it can be expanded in an unreliable network
environment. DyoCense supports versions 3.1.1 and 5.0.0 of MQTT.

The MQTT Client library is implemented in many languages, including Embedded C, C, Java,
JavaScript, Python, C++, C#, Go, iOS, Android, and so on. Developers may select any of the MQTT
client libraries of their choice for interacting with DyoCense.
