#### Cloud to Device Message
---

This facility can be used to send one way messages to the device from cloud. These messages are
delivered only when the devices are connected to cloud. If devices are not connected at the time 
the message is initiated, the message will be lost forever. DyoCense cloud doesnâ€™t retry or trace
the messages sent via this topic.
